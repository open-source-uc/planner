"""
Fill the slots of a curriculum with courses, making sure that there is no overlap
within a block and respecting exclusivity rules.

General program flow when solving a curriculum:
1. A curriculum tree is built from external sources such as SIDING (see
    `sync.siding.translate`).
2. Some hand-written transformations are applied on the tree (see
    `sync.siding.siding_rules`), and the result is a curriculum tree as defined in
    `plan.validation.curriculum.tree`.
    This tree is not yet a graph, but instead is a "blueprint" to build a graph later.
3. When a plan needs to be validated, `solve_curriculum` is called with the taken
    courses and the curriculum tree as arguments.
4. A flow network is built, with each unit of flow representing a single credit. Each
    unit of flow that reaches the flow sink represents a credit in the curriculum.
    Flow can be sourced from a taken course, or from a virtual filler course.
    Filler courses represent courses that have not yet been taken, but *could* be taken.
    While building the network graph, a table is kept that maps from course codes to
    edge IDs in the graph, so that later we can identify which edge represents which
    course.
5. Min-cost-max-flow is run on the flow network.
    Virtual filler courses are given a high cost so that concrete taken courses are
    always preferred.
6. Once `solve_curriculum` returns, other modules like
    `plan.validation.curriculum.diagnose` analyze which edges have flow in them.
    If an edge from a filler course has flow, it means that some block could not be
    satisfied only with taken courses, and the solver had to fall back to filler
    courses.
    In this case, we report an error to the user.
7. When a user's plan is missing a course, sometimes there are several filler courses
    that could plug the hole equally well (or at least similarly well).
    However, the flow algorithm has to choose 1 option, and chooses that option
    arbitrarily.
    In order to determine all of the options that could satisfy a course, we have to
    find cycles in the solved graph.
    The `EquivalentFillerFinder` class helps with this.


The solved network (which is different than the curriculum tree) looks like this:

         course       instance          block
          edge          edge            edge       curriculum-tree edges
infinite -----> course -----> instance -----> leaf ----->  tree   -----> curriculum
 source          node  ----->   nodes  -----> node        nodes...          root

Each edge and node fulfills a different role:
    - Infinite source: The global source of flow (supersource).
    - Course edge: Has the course multiplicity as its edge capacity. This edge limits
    the amount of times a particular course can be coursed and still count towards
    the curriculum.
    - Course node: Distributes available flow for a particular course code within the
    course instances.
    - Instance edge: Limits the amount of credits a single instance can provide, and
    has an associated cost that depends on the particular course instance.
    For example, taken courses have a low cost and filler courses have a high cost.
    - Instance node: Distribute the available flow of an instance across the different
    curriculum blocks that a course can provide.
    - Block edge: Carries the flow between a particular course instance and a
    particular curriculum block that is being fed.
    Note that the specific curriculum blocks that a course can provide does not
    depend only on its course code.
    In particular, concrete courses with an associated equivalence can only count
    towards blocks that accept the equivalence.
    However, the same course with the same code, but tagged with another
    equivalence, would count towards other blocks.
    - Leaf node: Accepts flow from a set of courses, defined by the leaf.
    Called a leaf node because leaves in the curriculum tree are nodes of this type.
    - Tree nodes: The rest of the nodes are part of the structure of the curriculum
    itself.
    These nodes form a tree that eventually ends up in the root node.
    - Root node: The root of the curriculum graph. All flow ends up here. This is
    usually also an infinite sink that accepts all flow.

Note that for optimization some nodes may not physically exist in the flow network.
For example, any node that has one input and one output is useless, and is usually
replaced by a single edge.
In general, any node with one output that has at least as much output capacity as it
has input capacity is useless.
Similarly, any node with one input that has at least as much input capacity as it
has output capacity is useless.
