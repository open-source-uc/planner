"""
Fill the slots of a curriculum with courses, making sure that there is no overlap
within a block and respecting exclusivity rules.

Overview of the flow when solving a curriculum:
1. A curriculum tree is built from external sources such as SIDING, scrapes and
    hardcoded rules (see `sync.collate`).
2. The result is a curriculum tree, as defined in `plan.validation.curriculum.tree`.
    Along with a course database, this tree completely defines the curriculum.
3. When a plan needs to be validated, `solve_curriculum` is called with the taken
    courses and the curriculum tree as arguments.
4. Now, we build a flow network (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_network), where
    taken courses act as flow sources, and a single sink consumes this flow.
    The flow network is based on the curriculum tree.
    In particular, a source node is created for each taken course, and it is connected
    to the leaves of the curriculum tree that accept this course.
    The root of the curriculum tree becomes the sink.
5. A variation of min-cost-max-flow (see
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem) is run on the tree.
    In particular, we add virtual "filler courses" that are able to supply enough flow
    to fill the network, but with a high cost.
    Taken courses, on the other hand, have a low cost.
    Therefore, running min-cost-max-flow tries to fill the network with flow with
    the least cost. That is, the least amount of virtual courses.
6. Once `solve_curriculum` returns, other modules like
    `plan.validation.curriculum.diagnose` analyze which edges have flow in them.
    The courses that supply flow are "active".
    If a filler course is active, it means the solver could not find a way to fill the
    network with flow with only taken courses, so some courses need to be added to the
    plan to make it complete.
    This is interpreted as the solver suggesting to add the filler course to the plan.

Some extra details:
- Courses have limited multiplicity. This means that taking the course twice may not
    contribute more flow to the network.
    Most courses can be taken only once (and still contribute), but some have stranger
    restrictions.
    For example, abstract courses (like "any OFG") can be taken multiple times.
    Some are even stranger, like sports selection team courses, which can count up to 2
    times.
    Some courses share their flow budget. For example, courses ICS1113 and ICS113H are
    equivalent, and therefore even if the two are taken together, only 1 can provide
    flow.
    To model all of these situations, courses may share a common source node, with
    limited flow capacity.
- Sometimes there are several options to choose fillers.
    This represents that there are several valid ways to fill the plan, for example
    choosing an OPI or a different minor optative.
    This choice is ultimately up to the user, so the solver should report all of the
    available options.
    To achieve this, the solver checks each potential filler to see which gaps can it
    fill.
- For optimization purposes, some nodes that exist in the curriculum tree may not exist
    in the actually optimized flow network.
    For example, if node A connected to node B, B connected to node C, and there were no
    other connections to B, node B could be completely eliminated and replaced by a
    direct connection from A to C.

Some interesting combinations in terms of solving:
