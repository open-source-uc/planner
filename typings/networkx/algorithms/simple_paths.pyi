def is_simple_path(G, nodes): # -> bool:
    """Returns True if and only if `nodes` form a simple path in `G`.

    A *simple path* in a graph is a nonempty sequence of nodes in which
    no node appears more than once in the sequence, and each adjacent
    pair of nodes in the sequence is adjacent in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A NetworkX graph.
    nodes : list
        A list of one or more nodes in the graph `G`.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether the given list of nodes represents a simple path in `G`.

    Notes
    -----
    An empty list of nodes is not a path but a list of one node is a
    path. Here's an explanation why.

    This function operates on *node paths*. One could also consider
    *edge paths*. There is a bijection between node paths and edge
    paths.

    The *length of a path* is the number of edges in the path, so a list
    of nodes of length *n* corresponds to a path of length *n* - 1.
    Thus the smallest edge path would be a list of zero edges, the empty
    path. This corresponds to a list of one node.

    To convert between a node path and an edge path, you can use code
    like the following::

        >>> from networkx.utils import pairwise
        >>> nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3]
        >>> edges = list(pairwise(nodes))
        >>> edges
        [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
        >>> nodes = [edges[0][0]] + [v for u, v in edges]
        >>> nodes
        [0, 1, 2, 3]

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> nx.is_simple_path(G, [2, 3, 0])
    True
    >>> nx.is_simple_path(G, [0, 2])
    False

def all_simple_paths(G, source, target, cutoff=...): # -> Generator[Never, None, None] | Generator[list[Unknown], None, None]:
    """Generate all simple paths in the graph G from source to target.

    A simple path is a path with no repeated nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : nodes
       Single node or iterable of nodes at which to end path

    cutoff : integer, optional
        Depth to stop the search. Only paths of length <= cutoff are returned.

    Returns
    -------
    path_generator: generator
       A generator that produces lists of simple paths.  If there are no paths
       between the source and target within the given cutoff the generator
       produces no output. If it is possible to traverse the same sequence of
       nodes in multiple ways, namely through parallel edges, then it will be
       returned multiple times (once for each viable edge combination).

    Examples
    --------
    This iterator generates lists of nodes::

        >>> G = nx.complete_graph(4)
        >>> for path in nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3):
        ...     print(path)
        ...
        [0, 1, 2, 3]
        [0, 1, 3]
        [0, 2, 1, 3]
        [0, 2, 3]
        [0, 3]

    You can generate only those paths that are shorter than a certain
    length by using the `cutoff` keyword argument::

        >>> paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3, cutoff=2)
        >>> print(list(paths))
        [[0, 1, 3], [0, 2, 3], [0, 3]]

    To get each path as the corresponding list of edges, you can use the
    :func:`networkx.utils.pairwise` helper function::

        >>> paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3)
        >>> for path in map(nx.utils.pairwise, paths):
        ...     print(list(path))
        [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
        [(0, 1), (1, 3)]
        [(0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3)]
        [(0, 2), (2, 3)]
        [(0, 3)]

    Pass an iterable of nodes as target to generate all paths ending in any of several nodes::

        >>> G = nx.complete_graph(4)
        >>> for path in nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=[3, 2]):
        ...     print(path)
        ...
        [0, 1, 2]
        [0, 1, 2, 3]
        [0, 1, 3]
        [0, 1, 3, 2]
        [0, 2]
        [0, 2, 1, 3]
        [0, 2, 3]
        [0, 3]
        [0, 3, 1, 2]
        [0, 3, 2]

    Iterate over each path from the root nodes to the leaf nodes in a
    directed acyclic graph using a functional programming approach::

        >>> from itertools import chain
        >>> from itertools import product
        >>> from itertools import starmap
        >>> from functools import partial
        >>>
        >>> chaini = chain.from_iterable
        >>>
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (3, 2)])
        >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> leaves = (v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> all_paths = partial(nx.all_simple_paths, G)
        >>> list(chaini(starmap(all_paths, product(roots, leaves))))
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]

    The same list computed using an iterative approach::

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (3, 2)])
        >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> leaves = (v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> all_paths = []
        >>> for root in roots:
        ...     for leaf in leaves:
        ...         paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, root, leaf)
        ...         all_paths.extend(paths)
        >>> all_paths
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]

    Iterate over each path from the root nodes to the leaf nodes in a
    directed acyclic graph passing all leaves together to avoid unnecessary
    compute::

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4)])
        >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> leaves = [v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0]
        >>> all_paths = []
        >>> for root in roots:
        ...     paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, root, leaves)
        ...     all_paths.extend(paths)
        >>> all_paths
        [[0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 4], [2, 1, 3], [2, 1, 4]]

    If parallel edges offer multiple ways to traverse a given sequence of
    nodes, this sequence of nodes will be returned multiple times:

        >>> G = nx.MultiDiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 1), (1, 2)])
        >>> list(nx.all_simple_paths(G, 0, 2))
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm uses a modified depth-first search to generate the
    paths [1]_.  A single path can be found in $O(V+E)$ time but the
    number of simple paths in a graph can be very large, e.g. $O(n!)$ in
    the complete graph of order $n$.

    This function does not check that a path exists between `source` and
    `target`. For large graphs, this may result in very long runtimes.
    Consider using `has_path` to check that a path exists between `source` and
    `target` before calling this function on large graphs.

        If it is a function, the weight of an edge is the value returned
