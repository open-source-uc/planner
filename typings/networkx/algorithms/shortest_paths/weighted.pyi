    """Returns the shortest weighted path from source to target in G.

    Uses Dijkstra's Method to compute the shortest weighted path
    between two nodes in a graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
        Starting node

    target : node
        Ending node

    weight : string or function
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number.

    Returns
    -------
    path : list
        List of nodes in a shortest path.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If `source` is not in `G`.

    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> print(nx.dijkstra_path(G, 0, 4))
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d['color']=="red" else None``
    will find the shortest red path.

    The weight function can be used to include node weights.

    >>> def func(u, v, d):
    ...     node_u_wt = G.nodes[u].get("node_weight", 1)
    ...     node_v_wt = G.nodes[v].get("node_weight", 1)
    ...     edge_wt = d.get("weight", 1)
    ...     return node_u_wt / 2 + node_v_wt / 2 + edge_wt

    In this example we take the average of start and end node
    weights of an edge and add it to the weight of the edge.

    The function :func:`single_source_dijkstra` computes both
    path and length-of-path if you need both, use that.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    cutoff : integer or float, optional
        Length (sum of edge weights) at which the search is stopped.
        If cutoff is provided, only return paths with summed weight <= cutoff.

    weight : string or function
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edge[u][v][weight]``). If no

        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number.

    Yields
    ------
    (node, (distance, path)) : (node obj, (dict, dict))
        Each source node has two associated dicts. The first holds distance
        keyed by target and the second holds paths keyed by target.
        (See single_source_dijkstra for the source/target node terminology.)
        If desired you can apply `dict()` to this function to create a dict
        keyed by source node to the two dicts.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)

    The algorithm has a running time of $O(mn)$ where $n$ is the number of

    can handle negative edge weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The algorithm works for all types of graphs, including directed
        graphs and multigraphs.

        Starting node for path

    weight : string or function
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the

        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no

        If the (di)graph contains a negative (di)cycle, the

    The cycle consists of a list of nodes in the cycle order. The last
    node equals the first to make it a cycle.
    You can look up the edge weights in the original graph. In the case
    of multigraphs the relevant edge is the minimal weight edge between
    the nodes in the 2-tuple.

    >>> print(length)
    4

    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d['color']=="red" else None``
    will find the shortest red path.

    In practice  bidirectional Dijkstra is much more than twice as fast as
    ordinary Dijkstra.

    Ordinary Dijkstra expands nodes in a sphere-like manner from the
    source. The radius of this sphere will eventually be the length
    of the shortest path. Bidirectional Dijkstra will expand nodes
    from both the source and the target, making two spheres of half
    this radius. Volume of the first sphere is `\pi*r*r` while the
    others are `2*\pi*r/2*r/2`, making up half the volume.

    This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
    are negative or are floating point numbers
    (overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).

    Notes
    -----
    Johnson's algorithm is suitable even for graphs with negative weights. It
    works by using the Bellman–Ford algorithm to compute a transformation of
    the input graph that removes all negative weights, allowing Dijkstra's
    algorithm to be used on the transformed graph.

    The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2 \log n + n m)$,
    where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ the number of edges in the
    graph. For dense graphs, this may be faster than the Floyd–Warshall
    algorithm.
