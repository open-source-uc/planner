    """Compute current-flow closeness centrality for nodes.

    Current-flow closeness centrality is variant of closeness
    centrality based on effective resistance between nodes in
    a network. This metric is also known as information centrality.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
      If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.
      The weight reflects the capacity or the strength of the
      edge.

    dtype: data type (default=float)
      Default data type for internal matrices.
      Set to np.float32 for lower memory consumption.

    solver: string (default='lu')
       Type of linear solver to use for computing the flow matrix.
       Options are "full" (uses most memory), "lu" (recommended), and
       "cg" (uses least memory).

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with current flow closeness centrality as the value.

    closeness_centrality

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm is from Brandes [1]_.

    See also [2]_ for the original definition of information centrality.
