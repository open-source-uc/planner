=================================
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
=================================

Implementation of approximate algorithms
for solving and approximating the TSP problem.

Categories of algorithms which are implemented:

- Christofides (provides a 3/2-approximation of TSP)
- Greedy
- Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Threshold Accepting (TA)
- Asadpour Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Algorithm

The Travelling Salesman Problem tries to find, given the weight
(distance) between all points where a salesman has to visit, the
route so that:

- The total distance (cost) which the salesman travels is minimized.
- The salesman returns to the starting point.
- Note that for a complete graph, the salesman visits each point once.

The function `travelling_salesman_problem` allows for incomplete
graphs by finding all-pairs shortest paths, effectively converting
the problem to a complete graph problem. It calls one of the
approximate methods on that problem and then converts the result
back to the original graph using the previously found shortest paths.

TSP is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization,
important in operations research and theoretical computer science.

    """Find the shortest path in `G` connecting specified nodes

    This function allows approximate solution to the traveling salesman
    problem on networks that are not complete graphs and/or where the
    salesman does not need to visit all nodes.

    This function proceeds in two steps. First, it creates a complete
    graph using the all-pairs shortest_paths between nodes in `nodes`.
    Edge weights in the new graph are the lengths of the paths
    between each pair of nodes in the original graph.
    Second, an algorithm (default: `christofides` for undirected and
    `asadpour_atsp` for directed) is used to approximate the minimal Hamiltonian
    cycle on this new graph. The available algorithms are:

     - christofides
     - greedy_tsp
     - simulated_annealing_tsp
     - threshold_accepting_tsp
     - asadpour_atsp

    Once the Hamiltonian Cycle is found, this function post-processes to
    accommodate the structure of the original graph. If `cycle` is ``False``,
    the biggest weight edge is removed to make a Hamiltonian path.
    Then each edge on the new complete graph used for that analysis is
    replaced by the shortest_path between those nodes on the original graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A possibly weighted graph

    nodes : collection of nodes (default=G.nodes)
        collection (list, set, etc.) of nodes to visit

    weight : string, optional (default="weight")
        Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.
        If any edge does not have this attribute the weight is set to 1.

    cycle : bool (default: True)
        Indicates whether a cycle should be returned, or a path.
        Note: the cycle is the approximate minimal cycle.
        The path simply removes the biggest edge in that cycle.

    method : function (default: None)
        A function that returns a cycle on all nodes and approximates
        the solution to the traveling salesman problem on a complete
        graph. The returned cycle is then used to find a corresponding
        solution on `G`. `method` should be callable; take inputs
        `G`, and `weight`; and return a list of nodes along the cycle.

        Provided options include :func:`christofides`, :func:`greedy_tsp`,
        :func:`simulated_annealing_tsp` and :func:`threshold_accepting_tsp`.

        If `method is None`: use :func:`christofides` for undirected `G` and
        :func:`threshold_accepting_tsp` for directed `G`.

        To specify parameters for these provided functions, construct lambda
        functions that state the specific value. `method` must have 2 inputs.

    Returns an approximate solution to the traveling salesman problem.

    This approximate solution is one of the best known approximations for the
    asymmetric traveling salesman problem developed by Asadpour et al,
    [1]_. The algorithm first solves the Held-Karp relaxation to find a lower
    bound for the weight of the cycle. Next, it constructs an exponential
    distribution of undirected spanning trees where the probability of an
    edge being in the tree corresponds to the weight of that edge using a
    maximum entropy rounding scheme. Next we sample that distribution
    $2 \\lceil \\ln n \\rceil$ times and save the minimum sampled tree once the
    direction of the arcs is added back to the edges. Finally, we augment
    then short circuit that graph to find the approximate tour for the
    salesman.

    -------
    cycle : list of nodes
        Returns the cycle (list of nodes) that a salesman can follow to minimize

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation of a greedy algorithm is based on the following:

    - The algorithm adds a node to the solution at every iteration.
    - The algorithm selects a node not already in the cycle whose connection
      to the previous node adds the least cost to the cycle.

    A greedy algorithm does not always give the best solution.
    However, it can construct a first feasible solution which can
    be passed as a parameter to an iterative improvement algorithm such
    as Simulated Annealing, or Threshold Accepting.

    """Returns an approximate solution to the traveling salesman problem.

    This function uses simulated annealing to approximate the minimal cost
    cycle through the nodes. Starting from a suboptimal solution, simulated
    annealing perturbs that solution, occasionally accepting changes that make
    the solution worse to escape from a locally optimal solution. The chance
    of accepting such changes decreases over the iterations to encourage
    an optimal result.  In summary, the function returns a cycle starting
    at `source` for which the total cost is minimized. It also returns the cost.

    The chance of accepting a proposed change is related to a parameter called
    the temperature (annealing has a physical analogue of steel hardening
    as it cools). As the temperature is reduced, the chance of moves that
    increase cost goes down.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph
        `G` should be a complete weighted undirected graph.
        The distance between all pairs of nodes should be included.

    init_cycle : list of all nodes or "greedy"
        The initial solution (a cycle through all nodes returning to the start).
        This argument has no default to make you think about it.
        If "greedy", use `greedy_tsp(G, weight)`.
        Other common starting cycles are `list(G) + [next(iter(G))]` or the final
        result of `simulated_annealing_tsp` when doing `threshold_accepting_tsp`.

    weight : string, optional (default="weight")
        Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.
        If any edge does not have this attribute the weight is set to 1.

    source : node, optional (default: first node in list(G))
        Starting node.  If None, defaults to ``next(iter(G))``

    temp : int, optional (default=100)
        The algorithm's temperature parameter. It represents the initial
        value of temperature

    move : "1-1" or "1-0" or function, optional (default="1-1")
        Indicator of what move to use when finding new trial solutions.
        Strings indicate two special built-in moves:

        - "1-1": 1-1 exchange which transposes the position
          of two elements of the current solution.
          The function called is :func:`swap_two_nodes`.
          For example if we apply 1-1 exchange in the solution
          ``A = [3, 2, 1, 4, 3]``
          we can get the following by the transposition of 1 and 4 elements:
          ``A' = [3, 2, 4, 1, 3]``
        - "1-0": 1-0 exchange which moves an node in the solution
          to a new position.
          The function called is :func:`move_one_node`.
          For example if we apply 1-0 exchange in the solution
          ``A = [3, 2, 1, 4, 3]``
          we can transfer the fourth element to the second position:
          ``A' = [3, 4, 2, 1, 3]``

        You may provide your own functions to enact a move from
        one solution to a neighbor solution. The function must take
        the solution as input along with a `seed` input to control
        random number generation (see the `seed` input here).
        Your function should maintain the solution as a cycle with
        equal first and last node and all others appearing once.
        Your function should return the new solution.

    max_iterations : int, optional (default=10)
        Declared done when this number of consecutive iterations of
        the outer loop occurs without any change in the best cost solution.

    N_inner : int, optional (default=100)
        The number of iterations of the inner loop.

    alpha : float between (0, 1), optional (default=0.01)
        Percentage of temperature decrease in each iteration
        of outer loop

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    cycle : list of nodes
        Returns the cycle (list of nodes) that a salesman
        can follow to minimize total weight of the trip.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `G` is not complete the algorithm raises an exception.

    Notes
    -----
    Simulated Annealing is a metaheuristic local search algorithm.
    The main characteristic of this algorithm is that it accepts
    even solutions which lead to the increase of the cost in order
    to escape from low quality local optimal solutions.

    This algorithm needs an initial solution. If not provided, it is
    constructed by a simple greedy algorithm. At every iteration, the
    algorithm selects thoughtfully a neighbor solution.
    Consider $c(x)$ cost of current solution and $c(x')$ cost of a
    neighbor solution.
    If $c(x') - c(x) <= 0$ then the neighbor solution becomes the current
    solution for the next iteration. Otherwise, the algorithm accepts
    the neighbor solution with probability $p = exp - ([c(x') - c(x)] / temp)$.
    Otherwise the current solution is retained.

    `temp` is a parameter of the algorithm and represents temperature.

    Time complexity:
    For $N_i$ iterations of the inner loop and $N_o$ iterations of the
    outer loop, this algorithm has running time $O(N_i * N_o * |V|)$.

    cycle through the nodes. Starting from a suboptimal solution, threshold
    accepting methods perturb that solution, accepting any changes that make
    the solution no worse than increasing by a threshold amount. Improvements
    in cost are accepted, but so are changes leading to small increases in cost.
    This allows the solution to leave suboptimal local minima in solution space.
    The threshold is decreased slowly as iterations proceed helping to ensure
    an optimum. In summary, the function returns a cycle starting at `source`
    for which the total cost is minimized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph
        `G` should be a complete weighted undirected graph.
        The distance between all pairs of nodes should be included.

    init_cycle : list or "greedy"
        The initial solution (a cycle through all nodes returning to the start).
        This argument has no default to make you think about it.
        If "greedy", use `greedy_tsp(G, weight)`.
        Other common starting cycles are `list(G) + [next(iter(G))]` or the final
        result of `simulated_annealing_tsp` when doing `threshold_accepting_tsp`.

    weight : string, optional (default="weight")
        Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.
        If any edge does not have this attribute the weight is set to 1.

    source : node, optional (default: first node in list(G))
        Starting node.  If None, defaults to ``next(iter(G))``

    threshold : int, optional (default=1)
        The algorithm's threshold parameter. It represents the initial
        threshold's value

    move : "1-1" or "1-0" or function, optional (default="1-1")
        Indicator of what move to use when finding new trial solutions.
        Strings indicate two special built-in moves:

        - "1-1": 1-1 exchange which transposes the position
          of two elements of the current solution.
          The function called is :func:`swap_two_nodes`.
          For example if we apply 1-1 exchange in the solution
          ``A = [3, 2, 1, 4, 3]``
          we can get the following by the transposition of 1 and 4 elements:
          ``A' = [3, 2, 4, 1, 3]``
        - "1-0": 1-0 exchange which moves an node in the solution
          to a new position.
          The function called is :func:`move_one_node`.
          For example if we apply 1-0 exchange in the solution
          ``A = [3, 2, 1, 4, 3]``
          we can transfer the fourth element to the second position:
          ``A' = [3, 4, 2, 1, 3]``

        You may provide your own functions to enact a move from
        one solution to a neighbor solution. The function must take
        the solution as input along with a `seed` input to control
        random number generation (see the `seed` input here).
        Your function should maintain the solution as a cycle with
        equal first and last node and all others appearing once.
        Your function should return the new solution.

    max_iterations : int, optional (default=10)
        Declared done when this number of consecutive iterations of
        the outer loop occurs without any change in the best cost solution.

    N_inner : int, optional (default=100)
        The number of iterations of the inner loop.

    alpha : float between (0, 1), optional (default=0.1)
        Percentage of threshold decrease when there is at
        least one acceptance of a neighbor solution.
        If no inner loop moves are accepted the threshold remains unchanged.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    cycle : list of nodes
        Returns the cycle (list of nodes) that a salesman
        can follow to minimize total weight of the trip.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `G` is not complete the algorithm raises an exception.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.algorithms import approximation as approx
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from({
    ...     ("A", "B", 3), ("A", "C", 17), ("A", "D", 14), ("B", "A", 3),
    ...     ("B", "C", 12), ("B", "D", 16), ("C", "A", 13),("C", "B", 12),
    ...     ("C", "D", 4), ("D", "A", 14), ("D", "B", 15), ("D", "C", 2)
    ... })
    >>> cycle = approx.threshold_accepting_tsp(G, "greedy", source="D")
    >>> cost = sum(G[n][nbr]["weight"] for n, nbr in nx.utils.pairwise(cycle))
    >>> cycle
    ['D', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'D']
    >>> cost
    31
    >>> incycle = ["D", "B", "A", "C", "D"]
    >>> cycle = approx.threshold_accepting_tsp(G, incycle, source="D")
    >>> cost = sum(G[n][nbr]["weight"] for n, nbr in nx.utils.pairwise(cycle))
    >>> cycle
    ['D', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'D']
    >>> cost
    31

    Notes
    -----
    Threshold Accepting is a metaheuristic local search algorithm.
    The main characteristic of this algorithm is that it accepts
    even solutions which lead to the increase of the cost in order
    to escape from low quality local optimal solutions.

    This algorithm needs an initial solution. This solution can be
    constructed by a simple greedy algorithm. At every iteration, it
    selects thoughtfully a neighbor solution.
    Consider $c(x)$ cost of current solution and $c(x')$ cost of
    neighbor solution.
    If $c(x') - c(x) <= threshold$ then the neighbor solution becomes the current
    solution for the next iteration, where the threshold is named threshold.

    In comparison to the Simulated Annealing algorithm, the Threshold
    Accepting algorithm does not accept very low quality solutions
    (due to the presence of the threshold value). In the case of
    Simulated Annealing, even a very low quality solution can
    be accepted with probability $p$.

    Time complexity:
    It has a running time $O(m * n * |V|)$ where $m$ and $n$ are the number
    of times the outer and inner loop run respectively.
