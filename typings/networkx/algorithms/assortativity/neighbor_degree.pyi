def average_neighbor_degree(G, source=..., target=..., nodes=..., weight=...): # -> dict[Unknown, Unknown]:
    r"""Returns the average degree of the neighborhood of each node.

    In an undirected graph, the neighborhood `N(i)` of node `i` contains the
    nodes that are connected to `i` by an edge.

    For directed graphs, `N(i)` is defined according to the parameter `source`:

        - if source is 'in', then `N(i)` consists of predecessors of node `i`.
        - if source is 'out', then `N(i)` consists of successors of node `i`.
        - if source is 'in+out', then `N(i)` is both predecessors and successors.

    The average neighborhood degree of a node `i` is

    .. math::

        k_{nn,i} = \frac{1}{|N(i)|} \sum_{j \in N(i)} k_j

    where `N(i)` are the neighbors of node `i` and `k_j` is
    the degree of node `j` which belongs to `N(i)`. For weighted
    graphs, an analogous measure can be defined [1]_,

    .. math::

        k_{nn,i}^{w} = \frac{1}{s_i} \sum_{j \in N(i)} w_{ij} k_j

    where `s_i` is the weighted degree of node `i`, `w_{ij}`
    is the weight of the edge that links `i` and `j` and
    `N(i)` are the neighbors of node `i`.


    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : string ("in"|"out"|"in+out"), optional (default="out")
       Directed graphs only.
       Use "in"- or "out"-neighbors of source node.

    target : string ("in"|"out"|"in+out"), optional (default="out")
       Directed graphs only.
       Use "in"- or "out"-degree for target node.

    nodes : list or iterable, optional (default=G.nodes)
        Compute neighbor degree only for specified nodes.

    weight : string or None, optional (default=None)
       The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used as a weight.
       If None, then each edge has weight 1.

    Returns
    -------
    d: dict
       A dictionary keyed by node to the average degree of its neighbors.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If either `source` or `target` are not one of 'in', 'out', or 'in+out'.
        If either `source` or `target` is passed for an undirected graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> G.edges[0, 1]["weight"] = 5
    >>> G.edges[2, 3]["weight"] = 3

    >>> nx.average_neighbor_degree(G)
    {0: 2.0, 1: 1.5, 2: 1.5, 3: 2.0}
    >>> nx.average_neighbor_degree(G, weight="weight")
    {0: 2.0, 1: 1.1666666666666667, 2: 1.25, 3: 2.0}

    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> nx.add_path(G, [0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> nx.average_neighbor_degree(G, source="in", target="in")
    {0: 0.0, 1: 0.0, 2: 1.0, 3: 1.0}

    >>> nx.average_neighbor_degree(G, source="out", target="out")
    {0: 1.0, 1: 1.0, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0}
