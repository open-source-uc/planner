    """Checks whether the given joint degree dictionary is realizable.

    A *joint degree dictionary* is a dictionary of dictionaries, in
    which entry ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` is an integer representing the
    number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with nodes of degree
    *l*. Such a dictionary is realizable as a simple graph if and only
    if the following conditions are satisfied.

    - each entry must be an integer,
    - the total number of nodes of degree *k*, computed by
      ``sum(joint_degrees[k].values()) / k``, must be an integer,
    - the total number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with
      nodes of degree *l* cannot exceed the total number of possible edges,
    - each diagonal entry ``joint_degrees[k][k]`` must be even (this is
      a convention assumed by the :func:`joint_degree_graph` function).


    Parameters
    ----------
    joint_degrees :  dictionary of dictionary of integers
        A joint degree dictionary in which entry ``joint_degrees[k][l]``
        is the number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with nodes of
        degree *l*.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether the given joint degree dictionary is realizable as a
        simple graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    joint_degrees :  dictionary of dictionary of integers
        A joint degree dictionary in which entry ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` is the
        number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with nodes of degree *l*.

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph
        A graph with the specified joint degree dictionary.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If *joint_degrees* dictionary is not realizable.

    Notes
    -----
    In each iteration of the "while loop" the algorithm picks two disconnected
    nodes *v* and *w*, of degree *k* and *l* correspondingly,  for which
    ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` has not reached its target yet. It then adds
    edge (*v*, *w*) and increases the number of edges in graph G by one.

    The intelligence of the algorithm lies in the fact that  it is always
    possible to add an edge between such disconnected nodes *v* and *w*,
    even if one or both nodes do not have free stubs. That is made possible by
    executing a "neighbor switch", an edge rewiring move that releases
    a free stub while keeping the joint degree of G the same.

    The algorithm continues for E (number of edges) iterations of
    the "while loop", at the which point all entries of the given
    ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` have reached their target values and the
    construction is complete.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_degrees :  list of integers
        in degree sequence contains the in degrees of nodes.

        out degree sequence contains the out degrees of nodes.
    nkk  :  dictionary of dictionary of integers

    boolean

    Notes
    -----
    Here is the list of conditions that the inputs (in/out degree sequences,
    nkk) need to satisfy for simple directed graph realizability:

    - Condition 0: in_degrees and out_degrees have the same length
    - Condition 1: nkk[k][l]  is integer for all k,l
    - Condition 2: sum(nkk[k])/k = number of nodes with partition id k, is an
                   integer and matching degree sequence
    - Condition 3: number of edges and non-chords between k and l cannot exceed
                   maximum possible number of edges

    ----------
    degree_seq :  list of tuples (of size 3)

        out degree.

    Notes
    -----
    Similarly to the undirected version:
    In each iteration of the "while loop" the algorithm picks two disconnected
    nodes v and w, of degree k and l correspondingly,  for which nkk[k][l] has
    not reached its target yet i.e. (for given k,l): n_edges_add < nkk[k][l].
    It then adds edge (v,w) and always increases the number of edges in graph G
    by one.

    The intelligence of the algorithm lies in the fact that  it is always
    possible to add an edge between disconnected nodes v and w, for which
    nkk[degree(v)][degree(w)] has not reached its target, even if one or both
    nodes do not have free stubs. If either node v or w does not have a free
    stub, we perform a "neighbor switch", an edge rewiring move that releases a
    free stub while keeping nkk the same.

    The difference for the directed version lies in the fact that neighbor
    switches might not be able to rewire, but in these cases unsaturated nodes
    can be reassigned to use instead, see [1] for detailed description and
    proofs.

    The algorithm continues for E (number of edges in the graph) iterations of
    the "while loop", at which point all entries of the given nkk[k][l] have
    reached their target values and the construction is complete.
