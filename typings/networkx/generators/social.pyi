def karate_club_graph(): # -> Graph:
    """Returns Zachary's Karate Club graph.

    Each node in the returned graph has a node attribute 'club' that
    indicates the name of the club to which the member represented by that node
    belongs, either 'Mr. Hi' or 'Officer'. Each edge has a weight based on the
    number of contexts in which that edge's incident node members interacted.

    Examples
    --------
    To get the name of the club to which a node belongs::

        >>> G = nx.karate_club_graph()
        >>> G.nodes[5]["club"]
        'Mr. Hi'
        >>> G.nodes[9]["club"]
        'Officer'
