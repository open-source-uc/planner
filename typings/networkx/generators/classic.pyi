    Many well-known graph families are subfamilies of the circulant graphs;

    node to nodes on either side (with offset plus or minus one). For n = 10,

    ...
    >>> sorted(edges) == sorted(G.edges())
    True

    Similarly, we can create the complete graph
    on 5 points with the set of offsets [1, 2]:

    >>> G = nx.circulant_graph(5, [1, 2])

    ...     (0, 1),

    Notes
    -----
    The variable create_using should be a Graph Constructor or a
    "graph"-like object. Constructors, e.g. `nx.Graph` or `nx.MultiGraph`
    will be used to create the returned graph. "graph"-like objects
    will be cleared (nodes and edges will be removed) and refitted as
    an empty "graph" with nodes specified in n. This capability
    is useful for specifying the class-nature of the resulting empty
    "graph" (i.e. Graph, DiGraph, MyWeirdGraphClass, etc.).

    The variable create_using has three main uses:
    Firstly, the variable create_using can be used to create an
    empty digraph, multigraph, etc.  For example,

    >>> n = 10
    >>> G = nx.empty_graph(n, create_using=nx.DiGraph)

    will create an empty digraph on n nodes.

    Secondly, one can pass an existing graph (digraph, multigraph,
    etc.) via create_using. For example, if G is an existing graph
    (resp. digraph, multigraph, etc.), then empty_graph(n, create_using=G)
    will empty G (i.e. delete all nodes and edges using G.clear())
    and then add n nodes and zero edges, and return the modified graph.

    Thirdly, when constructing your home-grown graph creation function
    you can use empty_graph to construct the graph by passing a user
    defined create_using to empty_graph. In this case, if you want the
    default constructor to be other than nx.Graph, specify `default`.

    >>> def mygraph(n, create_using=None):
    ...     G = nx.empty_graph(n, create_using, nx.MultiGraph)
    ...     G.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (0, 1)])
    ...     return G
    >>> G = mygraph(3)
    >>> G.is_multigraph()
