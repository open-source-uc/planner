    """Returns a NetworkX Graph or DiGraph from a PyGraphviz graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : PyGraphviz AGraph
      A graph created with PyGraphviz

    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=None)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
       If `None`, then the appropriate Graph type is inferred from `A`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> K5 = nx.complete_graph(5)
    >>> A = nx.nx_agraph.to_agraph(K5)
    >>> G = nx.nx_agraph.from_agraph(A)

    Notes
    -----
    The Graph G will have a dictionary G.graph_attr containing
    the default graphviz attributes for graphs, nodes and edges.

    Default node attributes will be in the dictionary G.node_attr
    which is keyed by node.

    Edge attributes will be returned as edge data in G.  With
    edge_attr=False the edge data will be the Graphviz edge weight
    attribute or the value 1 if no edge weight attribute is found.

    Notes
    -----
    If N has an dict N.graph_attr an attempt will be made first
    to copy properties attached to the graph (see from_agraph)
    and then updated with the calling arguments if any.

    Notes
    -----
    If you use complex node objects, they may have the same string
    representation and GraphViz could treat them as the same node.
    The layout may assign both nodes a single location. See Issue #1568
    If this occurs in your case, consider relabeling the nodes just
    for the layout computation using something similar to::

        >>> H = nx.convert_node_labels_to_integers(G, label_attribute="node_label")
        >>> H_layout = nx.nx_agraph.pygraphviz_layout(G, prog="dot")

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The machine to draw.
    edgelabel : str, callable, None
        If a string, then it specifes the edge attribute to be displayed
        on the edge labels. If a callable, then it is called for each
        edge and it should return the string to be displayed on the edges.
        The function signature of `edgelabel` should be edgelabel(data),
        where `data` is the edge attribute dictionary.
    prog : string
        Name of Graphviz layout program.
    args : str
        Additional arguments to pass to the Graphviz layout program.
    suffix : str
        If `filename` is None, we save to a temporary file.  The value of
        `suffix` will appear at the tail end of the temporary filename.
    path : str, None
        The filename used to save the image.  If None, save to a temporary
        file.  File formats are the same as those from pygraphviz.agraph.draw.
    show : bool, default = True
        Whether to display the graph with :mod:`PIL.Image.show`,
        default is `True`. If `False`, the rendered graph is still available
        at `path`.

    Returns
    -------
    path : str
        The filename of the generated image.
    A : PyGraphviz graph
        The PyGraphviz graph instance used to generate the image.

    Notes
    -----
    If this function is called in succession too quickly, sometimes the
    image is not displayed. So you might consider time.sleep(.5) between
    calls if you experience problems.

    ----------

        A PyGraphviz AGraph instance.
    path :  file object

    format : str, None
        An attempt is made to guess the output format based on the extension
        of the filename. If that fails, the value of `format` is used.
