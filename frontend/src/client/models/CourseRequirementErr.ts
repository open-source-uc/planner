/**
 * Indicates that a course (`associated_to`) is missing some requirements (`missing`).
 *
 * - `missing`: The raw missing requirements, as specified in the course requirements.
 * This expression is simplified, and only contains the courses that are actually
 * missing.
 * - `missing_modernized`: Like `missing`, but course codes are replaced by their
 * modernized counterparts.
 * - `push_back`: If the `associated_to` course can be moved back some semesters an
 * then fulfill the requirements, this property is the index of that semester.
 * - `pull_forward`: If some requirements already exist in the plan but they are too
 * late to count as requirements for the `associate_to` course, they are listed
 * here, along with the semester that they would have to be moved to.
 * - `add_absent`: Requirements that are not in the plan and have to be added.
 * The modernized code is listed here.
